Hello! my name is sqohapoe
Recently I've discovered blissymbols and from then on I completely fell in love with it. 
After discussing with some other passionates, we all agree that we will be in need of a non-english based typing method.
Despite my little capacity of programming, I eagerly want to contribute something to the blissymbols community. 
So I've informed myself by consulting several related websites, and finally find this github, which is the most complete one so far. 
Thank you for all you have done they are wonderful works. 
I am trying to read you code now And I would like to ask you if there's anything I can help, thanks.
